/**
 * You are given the following :
 * <p>
 * A positive number N
 * Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
 * Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P
 * You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height
 * Consider that heights will be unique
 * Example
 * Input :
 * Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
 * InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
 * Output :
 * actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4
 * So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.
 * <p>
 * For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.
 * <p>
 * You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
