 Find largest distance
 Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes. The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree). The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

 The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.

 Example:
 If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree looks like this:
 0
 /  |  \
 1   2   3
 \
 4

 Solution: Find the most distant node from the root, let this is d1
 not find the most distant  root from d as answer
